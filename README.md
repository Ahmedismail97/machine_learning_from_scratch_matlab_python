# Coursera Machine Learning Course
All the work done by me as a part of Coursera's Machine Learning Course By Andrew Ng https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/ 
## What is the course about?
It's an excellent free online Stanford University Coursera machine learning class from the leaders of AI. 
This course is a must-take for anyone who is interested in Machine Learning. The course is taught by Andrew Ng a genius and an excellent popularizer, wich is a rare combination. 

## Python implementation
Since the course uses Octave/Matlab in programming assignments, I wanted to reimplement all of them in python
