# ML Course By Stanford University On Coursera
All the work done by me as a part of Coursera's Machine Learning Course + A Python üêç implementation.
## What is this course about?
It's an excellent Stanford University Coursera course from the leaders of AI. It is taught by [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng) a genius and an excellent popularizer, which is a rare combination. 
## Algorithms:
1.  **Linear regression** with one variable to predict proÔ¨Åts for a food truck
2.  **Regularized Linear regression** with multiple variables to predict the prices of houses
3.  **Regularized logistic regression** to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA)
4.  **Multi-class Logistic regression** to recognize handwritten digits 
5.  **Neural Networks** to recognize handwritten digits 
6.  **Support vector machines SVM** ( with and without Gaussian Kernels) to classify email (spam or not spam)
7.  **K-means** clustering algorithm for image compression
8.  **Principal component analysis (PCA)** to perform dimensionality reduction
9.  **Anomaly detection algorithm** to detect anomalous behavior in server computers of a data center
10. **Collaborative Ô¨Åltering recommender system** applied to a dataset of movie ratings
## üêç Python Implementation
Since the course uses Octave/Matlab in programming assignments, I wanted to reimplement each assignment in Python using only NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib
