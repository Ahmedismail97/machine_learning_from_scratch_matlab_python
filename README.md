# Coursera Machine Learning Course
All the work done by me as a part of Coursera's Machine Learning Course By Andrew Ng https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/ + A Python implementation
## What is the course about?
It's an excellent free online Stanford University Coursera machine learning class from the leaders of AI. 
This course is a must-take for anyone who is interested in Machine Learning. It is taught by Andrew Ng a genius and an excellent popularizer, which is a rare combination. 

## Python implementation
Since the course uses Octave/Matlab in programming assignments, I wanted to reimplement each assignment in Python using only NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib
